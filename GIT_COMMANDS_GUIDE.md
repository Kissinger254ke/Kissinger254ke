The `git status` command allows you to see the current state of your repository. It shows you which files are staged for commit, which are not, and which files are untracked.

To check the status of your Payback-2game-cheats repository:
```bash
cd Payback-2game-cheats
git status
```

### 2. `git init`
The `git init` command initializes a new Git repository. This is the first command you run when creating a new project.

**Example:**  
To create a new Git repository for a new project:
```bash
mkdir new-project
cd new-project
git init
```

### 3. `git clone`
The `git clone` command creates a copy of an existing repository. This is useful for downloading a repository from GitHub.

**Example:**  
To clone your WhatsAppBotMultiDevice repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kissinger254ke/WhatsAppBotMultiDevice.git
```

### 4. `git add`

```bash
cd Payback-2game-cheats
git add .
```

### 5. `git commit`
The `git commit` command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. It is essential for version control.

**Example:**  
To commit staged changes with a message:
```bash
git commit -m "Updated game cheats"
```

### 6. `git push`
The `git push` command uploads your local commits to a remote repository. This is how you share your changes with others.

**Example:**  
To push changes from your local Payback-2game-cheats repository to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 7. `git pull`
The `git pull` command fetches and merges changes from the remote repository to your local repository. This is essential for keeping your local copy up to date.

**Example:**  
To pull the latest changes from the WhatsAppBotMultiDevice repository:
```bash
cd WhatsAppBotMultiDevice
git pull origin main
```
